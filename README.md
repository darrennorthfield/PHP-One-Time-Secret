# PHP One Time Secret

Mostly built because I wanted a project to improve my PHP...

The idea is that you can share a password and as soon as the person you share it with clicks the link, the link is destroyed and can not be used again.

## Install
- Tested on PHP 7.0
- Requires composer
- Requires apache for htaccess

```
composer install
```
